_**TIC-TAC-TOE GAME**_

Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun game that two players can play together. It's also known as "Xs and Os." The game is usually played on a grid that has three rows and three columns, creating nine small squares in total.


To start, one player is "X," and the other player is "O." Players take turns putting their symbol in an empty square on the grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple but strategic game. Players need to think ahead to block their opponent's moves while also planning their own winning moves. 


It's a quick and enjoyable game.
